# useEffect Cleanup Function Not Always Executing in React 18/19

This repository demonstrates a potential issue where the cleanup function in React's `useEffect` hook might not consistently execute, particularly in scenarios involving rapid component unmounting or concurrent rendering.  This can lead to subtle bugs, such as memory leaks if resources aren't properly released.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The original `useEffect` hook uses `setInterval` to increment a counter. However, the `clearInterval` function within the cleanup function is not always called, potentially leading to memory leaks and unexpected behavior, particularly during fast component transitions.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the cleanup function is always executed when the component unmounts, thereby preventing resource leaks and ensuring clean behavior.
